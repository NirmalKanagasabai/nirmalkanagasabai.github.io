Hello! Welcome to my personal website! :)
Here's a brief description on the list of projects I have worked on until now:

### Predict the Winner (Miami Marathon 2017)

<p class="message"> This project was done as a part of <strong>COMP 551 (Applied Machine Learning)</strong> course at McGill University
</p>

The purpose of this project is to predict the final finishing time of the list of participants who have participated in the Miami Marathon 2017. To achieve this, I employed Linear Regression optimized with Gradient Descent Approach.  

* The input was a raw data set which was curated from the web. It contained the performance of past participants' in Miami Marathon. The dataset included the details from 2003 to 2016.
* Data Manipulation was done using 'R'. The raw dataset was widened across years. Each tuple is unique and referred to one participant.
* Then, the missing data issue was handled by Data Imputation (Predictive Mean Matching)
* This project involved K-Fold Cross Validation
* The final prediction was done and the Mean Squared Error was around 4000!

### Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

* Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via **â˜°** link in top corner
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
