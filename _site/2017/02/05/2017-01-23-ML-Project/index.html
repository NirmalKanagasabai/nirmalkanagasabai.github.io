<p>Hello! Welcome to my personal website! :)
Here’s a brief description on the list of projects I have worked on until now:</p>

<h3 id="predict-the-winner-miami-marathon-2017">Predict the Winner (Miami Marathon 2017)</h3>

<p class="message"> This project was done as a part of <strong>COMP 551 (Applied Machine Learning)</strong> course at McGill University
</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to predict the final finishing time of the list of participants who have participated in the Miami Marathon 2017. To achieve this, I employed Linear Regression optimized with Gradient Descent Approach.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The input was a raw data set which was curated from the web. It contained the performance of past participants’ in Miami Marathon. The dataset included the details from 2003 to 2016.</li>
  <li>Data Manipulation was done using ‘R’. The raw dataset was widened across years. Each tuple is unique and referred to one participant.</li>
  <li>Then, the missing data issue was handled by Data Imputation (Predictive Mean Matching)</li>
  <li>This project involved K-Fold Cross Validation</li>
  <li>The final prediction was done and the Mean Squared Error was around 4000!</li>
</ul>
