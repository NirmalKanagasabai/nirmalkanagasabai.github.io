Thanks for reading!

I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University, where I pursued my master's in Human-Computer Interaction with a dual degree from the University of Madeira, Portugal. Having come from a Computer Science background, I am intrigued by the convergence of technology and design. I would love to talk about any recent projects that I have worked on.

Thanks for visiting!
